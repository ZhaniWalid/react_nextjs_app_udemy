How to use the downloaded files

After completing the 'Dev' and want to ship our 'Deployed' project 
=> we need to ship it on host that is ready for 'nodeJS' (because after 'Deploy' all the code is on basic 'JavaScript'),
   and then Run "npm start" => in our case we have 'nodeJS' installed so we can Run "npm start" locally

A// On 'Shipment' (like this case, i took the project from 'Udemy' and run it on my machine) :
1) Run "npm install" in the extracted folder
2) Run "npm start" to view the project using 'NextJS'

B// On 'Development' (When i start my project from scratch, or also case 'A//' works => no prob ):
1) Run "npm run dev" to view the project using 'NextJS'
2) Run "npm run build" to build the project using 'NextJS'

Compare my code to yours to solve issues you might encounter. 
You may also copy the content of src/ into your own project's src/ folder to use your project setup (which might've been created with a different create-react-app version) and still use my code.

Hint :: => NextJS : Help us to 'point' to 'files' under 'folders' that are (='folders') considered as 'Routes'
    => for expample : <Link href="/auth"> ::
    => "/auth" => will point to '/auth' ('pages/auth') folder and acess to [index.js] File ('pages/auth'/index.js)
    ====> There is no need to use '<Route />' Component from the package 'react-router-dom'
